It is intended as an homage to my favorite action star of all time and the movies I grew up watching that still today provide some of the most memorable quotes.</p>

        <p>Gabe Rigall is an independent programmer/web developer/data analyst/machine learning enthusiast/evil genius who grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and playing card, board, and videogames. The inspiration for "Get to Da Choppa" came after a particularly riveting bout of "Marrying Mr. Darcy" wherein his wife soundly beat him to the punch (pun intended).</p>
